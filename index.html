  <h1>It is Sunday, June 23, 1867&hellip;</h1>
  <p>
    a week before Confederation. John A. Macdonald has fallen under the spell of a puzzling madness. Agnes Macdonald, fearing her husband won’t be able to assume his role as Prime Minister, has sent to the growing city of Toronto to seek your help in curing this affliction. What&mdash;or who&mdash;is behind it?
  </p>
  <p>
    You are a team of investigators: a group of Confederation-era Torontonians of importance, assembled at Agnes’s request to solve this mystery. It will lead your team all over downtown Toronto, exploring heritage sites, examining historical documents, and solving puzzles. Will you save the new nation?
  </p>
  <p>
    The Puzzling Madness of John A. Macdonald is a new kind of experience: a blend of escape room and historical tour. Investigators meet up and depart from the plaque on the front of the St. Lawrence Market, located at 93 Front St. E. in downtown Toronto. See <a href="/howitworks.html">FAQ</a> for more details.

      <h2>Agnes Macdonald</h2>
      <p>
        Agnes Macdonald is headstrong, impulsive, and devoutly religious. She is a skilled diarist who, in spite of the gender norms of the day, gets involved with politics. The proud second wife of John A. Macdonald, she may be the only person keeping him from drinking himself into an early grave.

      <h2>John A. Macdonald</h2>
      <p>
        A longstanding poltical figure in Upper Canada, John A. Macdonald is slated to become the Prime Minister of the soon-to-be "Canada" after Dominion Day. The only problem? He's been seized by a puzzling madness; it is up to you and Agnes to track down the causes and cure him!
      </p>

    <div class="bio bio-left">
      <img src="/img/cast_emily.jpg" />
      <h2>Dr. Emily Stowe</h2>
      <p>
        Dr. Emily Stowe was educated in New York, as no Canadian medical school would accept her. She is now Canada’s first practicing female doctor, having opened her practice on Richmond St. in Toronto in 1867. She also gives regular public lectures on health. However, she is currently practicing without a license; the UofT hasn’t allowed her to take the examination required&hellip;

    <div class="bio bio-right">
      <img src="/img/cast_sandford.jpg" />
      <h2>Sandford Fleming</h2>
      <p>
        Born and educated in Scotland, Fleming arrived in Canada in 1845 and immediately set out on an illustrious engineering career in the growing Canadian railway system. His vision? Connect Canada coast-to-coast with proper British rail. Rumour has it the crown may knight Fleming for his tireless feats of engineering. He’s also been mulling over the idea of “time zones”&hellip;

    <div class="bio bio-left">
      <img src="/img/cast_unknown.jpg" />
      <h2>Thornton Blackburn</h2>
      <p>
        Born in Virginia and raised as a slave, Thornton and his new bride Lucie escaped the US in 1833 under cover of Detroit’s Blackburn Riots. In Toronto, Thornton runs the city’s first cab company, whose distinctive colours are red and gold. He and his wife have amassed quite some property, which they rent at low rates to aid other new blacks in finding their feet in the country&hellip;

    <div class="bio bio-right">
      <img src="/img/cast_oronhyatekha.jpg" />
      <h2>Oronhyatekha</h2>
      <p>
        At just 25 years old, Oronhyatekha recently received his MD from the Toronto School of Medicine, but even before that he was already shaping up to be special. He met the Prince of Wales during the latter’s most recent visit to Canada, and that meeting spurred him to become the first aboriginal Oxford scholar. In his spare time, he is a competitive marksman.

      <img src="/img/cast_samuel.jpg" />
      <h2>Samuel Nordheimer</h2>
      <p>
        With his brother Abraham, Samuel co-owns and operates a variety of musical businesses and organizations. While not a musician himself, Samuel serves as president of the Toronto Philharmonic Society. The brothers are a part of a small but growing Jewish community in Toronto, which is currently in need of a synagogue&hellip;

    <div class="bio bio-right">
      <img src="/img/cast_charlotte.jpg" />
      <h2>Charlotte Nickinson</h2>
      <p>
        Charlotte Nickinson is a career actress who owned, for a time, the Lyceum theatre in Toronto. She is perhaps best known for her roles as Melanie in Napoleon’s Old Guard and Florence in Dombey and Son. She semi-retired from acting in 1858 when she married, but she still occasionally performs.
      </p>

    <div class="bio bio-left">
      <img src="/img/cast_mary.jpg" />
      <h2>Mary Ann Shadd</h2>
      <p>
        Mary wrote prolifically through her Provincial Freeman newspaper. She extolls the virtues of Canada and advocates living within one’s means. She now lives mainly in Detroit, where she is pursuing a teaching certificate. Her dream is to one day become a lawyer and help achieve women’s suffrage, but those goals still feel far off&hellip;
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="bio bio-right">
      <img src="/img/cast_unknown.jpg" />
      <h2>Patrick Boyle</h2>
      <p>
        Today, Boyle is one of the publishers in chief for Toronto’s Irish Canadian, the mouthpiece of pro-Irish, pro-Catholic sympathies in the city. With Fenian raids along the Niagara river, this isn’t a popular stance, but the paper’s criticisms of the Fenian violence have also perhaps driven away hardline Irish nationalist readership.
      </p>

    <div class="bio bio-left">
      <img src="/img/cast_unknown.jpg" />
      <h2>Brother George Maclean Rose</h2>
      <p>
        Brother George co-owns a publishing house, but spends much of his time pushing and pursuing the cause of Temperance. Different from Prohibition, Temperance calls for moderation in alcohol consumption rather than its abstention. Yet another of his callings is as a man of the cloth: he is a member of the First Unitarian congregation of Toronto.
      </p>

    <div class="bio bio-right">
      <img src="/img/cast_catharine.jpg" />
      <h2>Catharine Parr Traill</h2>
      <p>
        While her original career was writing children’s books, Catharine’s life was upended when she emigrated to Canada with her husband. She now writes everything from housekeeping manuals to treatises on Canadian botany. After some time in the backwoods, she and her husband eventually returned to city life, where she continues her botanical work.
      </p>

    <div class="bio bio-left">
      <img src="/img/cast_david.jpg" />
      <h2>David Walker</h2>
      <p>
        While his day job sees him at the Americana Hotel at Yonge and Front, David’s passion is curling with Toronto’s Red Jacket Rink. He participated in the first international curling tournament in Buffalo, which saw over 50 Canadian teams attending; these days, even the PM-to-be is a curler!
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="bio bio-right">
      <img src="/img/cast_joseph.jpg" />
      <h2>Joseph Workman</h2>
      <p>
        Joseph has dedicated his whole life to medical science. Today, he is the medical superintendent of Toronto’s Provincial Insane Asylum, where he has introduced a variety of reforms: reducing medication, improving dietary care, and healing with kindness among them. He also has a burgeoning political career, advocating for women’s rights, the poor, and secular education.
